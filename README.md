## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application is an API that can get information on locations, weather, etc... using a server that communicates between the front-end and back-end, so that the client gets the data they want.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
First, add the .env and json files to your app. Next, put npm init to create package.json. Get the server running and install the packages (libraries) you will need in the terminal, and then into the js file. Configure the app and tell the server to listen on the port, and finally write the routes and constructors to handle requests from the client. Add the superagent to all the your routes, and add more routes for the the client. 

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This application uses data files to hold the json files, such as the location.json and weather.json. README.md to put down information on the app and length of time it takes to work on it. Then it need the .env file with the POST at 3000. It also needs the package.json file and package.json file, which are down loaded on your terminal. The libraries that will be used for this app are express, cors, and dotenv. Also, added superagent. The languages used are json and js. 

## Change Log
