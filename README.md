## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application is an API that can get information on locations, weather, etc... using a server that communicates between the front-end and back-end, so that the client gets the data they want.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
First, add the .env and json files to your app. Next, put npm init to create package.json. Get the server running and install the packages (libraries) you will need in the terminal, and then into the js file. Configure the app and tell the server to listen on the port, and finally write the routes to handle requests from the client. 

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This application uses data files to hold the json files, such as the location.json and weather.json. README.md to put down information on the app and length of time it takes to work on it. Then it need the .env file with the POST at 3000. It also needs the package.json file and package.json file, which are down loaded on your terminal. The libraries that will be used for this app are express, cors, and dotenv. The languages used are json.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

08-17-2020 2:30pm - added necessary files for the main structure, down loaded package.json and package-lock.json, added libraries, and added information onto the README.md.
